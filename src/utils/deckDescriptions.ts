  "squirreled-away": "Build an army of adorable squirrels! Make tons of little critter tokens, feed them snacks (Food tokens), and overwhelm your opponents with cuteness overload. It's like running a woodland daycare that happens to be surprisingly effective at winning games.",
  
  "endless-punishment": "Punish your opponents every time they do ANYTHING. When they draw cards, they take damage. When they lose life, you draw cards. It's a scary demon deck from a haunted house where bad things happen to everyone... except you.",
  
  "draconic-rage": "DRAGONS! Big, angry, fire-breathing lizards that smash face. This deck makes dragon tokens when you deal damage, then those dragons deal MORE damage. It's basically 'How many dragons can we fit on the battlefield?' and the answer is always 'MORE!'",
  
  "elven-council": "Channel the wisdom of Lord of the Rings elves! This deck is all about looking at the top of your deck (scrying), drawing extra cards, and making smart decisions. It's like being Galadriel - elegant, powerful, and always knowing what's coming next.",
  
  "science": "Welcome to the Wasteland! This is a Fallout-themed deck about energy and artifacts. You collect energy counters like bottle caps in the wasteland, then spend them on cool technological effects. It's Mad Max meets science fair.",
  
  "vampiric-bloodline": "Vampire nobles throwing a gothic party! Make Blood tokens, sacrifice them for value, and use your vampires' aristocratic powers. It's elegant, it's dark, and everyone's dressed to kill (literally).",
  
  "animated-army": "Your enchantments and artifacts come to LIFE as creatures! That's right - your magical items get up and start fighting for you. It's like Toy Story but with mana rocks and the toys are actually useful in combat.",
  
  "sliver-swarm": "Alien hivemind insects that share abilities! Every Sliver you play makes ALL your Slivers better. One gives flying? Now they ALL fly. It's like a video game where your units get increasingly overpowered buffs, except it's intentional.",
  
  "peace-offering": "'Group hug' deck that makes friends! Give everyone cards, help them play their stuff, put +1/+1 counters everywhere... then win because you controlled the chaos the whole time. It's basically being the friendly neighbor who's secretly plotting.",
  
  "arcane-maelstrom": "SPELL COPYING MADNESS! Every instant spell you cast gets copied, then copied again, then... yeah. One lightning bolt becomes three. It's a spellslinger's dream where your commander (a dinosaur wizard, yes really) makes everything bonkers.",
